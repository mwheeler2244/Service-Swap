# ServiceSwap Refactoring Summary

## What was changed

The original `app/page.tsx` file was over 3,300 lines and contained everything in one file. This has been refactored into a more maintainable structure.

## New File Structure

```
├── app/
│   └── page.tsx                    # Main App component (significantly reduced)
├── types/
│   └── index.ts                    # All TypeScript interfaces
├── components/
│   ├── index.ts                    # Export barrel for components
│   ├── ui/
│   │   ├── UserAvatar.tsx          # Reusable avatar component
│   │   ├── ToggleSwitch.tsx        # Toggle switch component
│   │   └── Notification.tsx        # Notification component
│   ├── services/
│   │   └── ServiceCard.tsx         # Service card display component
│   └── chat/
│       └── MessageBubble.tsx       # Chat message component
├── utils/
│   └── styles.ts                   # CSS styles and utility functions
├── constants/
│   └── emojis.ts                   # Emoji constants
└── data/
    └── mockData.ts                 # Initial/mock data
```

## Benefits of this refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each component is now in its own file and focused on a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be easily imported and reused
3. **Testing**: Individual components can be unit tested in isolation
4. **Performance**: Better code splitting and tree-shaking opportunities
5. **Developer Experience**: Easier to navigate, find, and modify specific functionality
6. **Type Safety**: Types are centralized and can be shared across components
7. **Data Management**: Mock data is separated from component logic

## Components Still To Refactor

The following large modal components are still embedded in the main file and should be extracted:

- `ServiceDetailsModal` - Component for viewing service details
- `ScheduleModal` - Component for scheduling services

These can be moved to:

- `components/modals/ServiceDetailsModal.tsx`
- `components/modals/ScheduleModal.tsx`

## Import Pattern

The new structure uses path aliases (`@/types`, `@/components`, etc.) which should be configured in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

This refactoring maintains all existing functionality while making the codebase much more manageable and scalable.
